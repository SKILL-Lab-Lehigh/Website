Lucy Li was a RA/GA for Dr. Juan Zheng’s lab from the Fall semester of 2022 to Spring of 2023. She assisted in the collection of participant data and development of Aladdin instructional videos for Dr. Zheng’s experiments on integrating AI into a simulated learning environment to facilitate students’ engineering design. While pursuing her education as a mental health provider, Lucy appreciates how the experience greatly increased her awareness of the impact AI has on learning as well as its potential to benefit therapeutic practices. Lucy graduated in May 2024 with an M.Ed. in Mental Health Counseling from Lehigh University. Currently, Lucy is working as a therapist in Boston towards her Massachusetts state licensure, specializing in anxiety disorders using a cognitive-behavioral approach. In her free time, she enjoys traveling, playing video games, and trying new boba shops.
