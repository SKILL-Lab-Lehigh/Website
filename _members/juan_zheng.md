  Dr. Juan Zheng is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Education and Human Services at Lehigh University and principal investigator of the STEM Knowledge Integration & Learning Lab (SKILL). She earned her Ph.D. in Learning Sciences from McGill University, Canada.
Her interdisciplinary research focuses on designing technology-enhanced learning environments for STEM education, investigating three main areas:
<br>
- Emotional, motivational, and cognitive factors in self-regulated learning
- AI-enhanced simulations for STEM education
- K-12 students’ AI literacy development through problem-solving with intelligent tutoring systems
<br>
  Dr. Zheng’s innovative research methodology combines multimodal data collection, including facial expression analysis and physiological measurements, to conduct detailed examinations of learning processes. Her work bridges educational technology and learning sciences to advance understanding of how students learn and apply STEM knowledge effectively.
Through the SKILL lab, she leads initiatives to develop and evaluate cutting-edge learning technologies that support students' STEM knowledge integration and real-world application. Her research aims to create more effective, engaging, and accessible STEM learning experiences through technology-enhanced environments.
