description: The STEM Knowledge Integration & Learning Lab (SKILL) at Lehigh University, led by Dr. Juan Zheng, explores innovative ways to enhance STEM education through technology. The lab focuses on understanding how emotional, motivational, and cognitive factors shape self-regulated learning, developing AI-powered simulations, and promoting K-12 studentsâ€™ AI literacy through hands-on problem-solving. By combining advanced research methods like multimodal data analysis, the SKILL lab creates and evaluates cutting-edge tools to help students integrate STEM knowledge and apply it in real-world contexts.
