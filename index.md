# SKILL Lab 

The STEM Knowledge Integration & Learning Lab (SKILL) at Lehigh University, led by Dr. Juan Zheng, explores innovative ways to enhance STEM education through cutting-edge technology and evidence-based learning approaches. Using advanced research methods including facial expression analysis and physiological measurements, the lab investigates how students learn and apply STEM concepts, with particular focus on emotional factors, AI-enhanced simulations, and the development of AI literacy in K-12 students. Through its groundbreaking work at the intersection of educational technology and learning sciences, SKILL aims to create more engaging and effective learning environments that help students better understand and integrate STEM knowledge for real-world application.
